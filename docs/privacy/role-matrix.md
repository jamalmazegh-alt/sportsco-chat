# Clubero — Role Matrix

Effective access matrix after Phase 4 hardening. RLS is the source of truth — this document mirrors `public.*` policies.

## Roles

| Role          | Source                                         | Scope                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `super_admin` | `super_admins` table                           | Platform‑wide (support / DPO ops) |
| `admin`       | `club_members.role = 'admin'`                  | One club                          |
| `dirigeant`   | `club_members.role = 'dirigeant'`              | One club, restricted writes       |
| `coach`       | `club_members.role = 'coach'` + `team_members` | Their assigned teams              |
| `parent`      | `player_parents.parent_user_id`                | Their children only               |
| `player`      | `players.user_id`                              | Themselves                        |

R = read, RW = read+write, — = no access.

## Hardening notes (Phase 4)

- `player_parents` SELECT is no longer "any club member"; it is now `(self parent) ∪ (admin/coach of the player's club) ∪ super_admin`. Other parents and players cannot enumerate other families.
- `super_admin` is a separate table, never a column on `profiles`. Checked via `has_super_admin(uid)`.
- All role checks go through `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (`has_club_role`, `is_club_member`, `has_super_admin`, `is_parent_of_player`, `can_view_player_media`) — never inline `EXISTS` against `club_members` from a policy that is itself on `club_members` (avoids recursion).

## Adding a new role

1. Extend `app_role` enum (migration).
2. Add a `has_<role>` helper if needed.
3. Update each table's policies explicitly — never rely on a default.
4. Update this file and `data-map.md`.
